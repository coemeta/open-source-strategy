# CoÎµmeta Open Source Strategy Repo

This is the **Open Source Strategy** repository for [CoÎµmeta](https://coemeta.xyz), a Public Benefit LLC providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It's intended as: 

- a **collection of open-access resources** for other freelancers, 'solopreneurs' or small orgs ([squads](https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/) / [pods](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/pods) / [crews](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/practices/crewing) / [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) etc)
- a **public record of our evolving strategy, planning & execution**
- & a place for **collaboration, co-creation & collective sensemaking**

As our name reflects, CoÎµmeta is about **_finding truth together_**. \
Making **better sense** for **better places** through **better information, relation & process**.

This repo complements our [**Public Work Log**](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log), which offers a more narrative account of our journey & playbook as it develops. All of this is done in the spirit of **[working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public)**, contributing to **[knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons)**, "**finding the others**" & **leaving a trail + some resources** for those that follow. 

Comments, questions & suggestions are welcome via **Pull Requests**, [**Issues**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/issues) or [**Discussions**](https://github.com/orgs/coemeta/discussions)!

### Why open? (shouldn't strategy be secret? ðŸ¤«)
</summary>

1. <details><summary><b>We're playing positive-sum, infinite games</b></summary> 

   \
   As a mission-driven org focused on prosocial impact, [positive externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive) & [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)), **we're not afraid of being copied**. \
   \
   In fact _**the more we're copied, the more we all win**_. This is partly because we're playing [a different game](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=An_Introduction_to_Game_B): a [positive-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win-win_game), [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games#Finite_vs._infinite_games) where we 'win' by continuing to play. The game is collective growth & regeneration, exchange over extraction, cooperation over competition, relationships over objects, process over products. This game favors [abundance mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Abundance_and_scarcity) & recognizes the [many forms of capital](http://www.appleseedpermaculture.com/8-forms-of-capital/) beyond money & property. \
   \
   But we're not naive about the need for traditional capital to 'stay in business' & stay alive. And **we're not afraid to compete** with traditional profit-maximizing, extractive, scarcity-based, zero-sum business models â€” the old game. That game is dying of exhaustion, institutional decay, bureaucratic gridlock & most of all a hollow core â€” lacking meaning & humanity: no vibes, no [lore](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/on-lore). **It can't do what we can do**: it's inhuman & unnatural, the system dynamics are self-annihiliting. It has to defy gravity, scale endlessly, deceive perpetually, genuflect to VCs or financial market casino games. It has to "win", [we just have to keep playing](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/how-to-not-lose-at-4d-chess). \
   \
   Their game is ending, as finite games must. Our game is endless, regenerative, life-giving, convivial, self-sustaining, its own reward. Everyday, [more](https://www.enspiral.com/) & [more](https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/) join our game & [leave](https://www.ft.com/content/1270ee18-3ee0-4939-98a8-c4f40940e644) the [old](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/millennials-burned-by-hustle-culture-5670986/). As many [always have](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q). Regardless of what becomes of CoÎµmeta, the game endures.
   </details>
  
2. <details><summary><b>Classical business strategy</b></summary>
   
   \
   We can also justify this transparency on the terms of classical "old game" business strategy. In that world, it doesn't get much more canonical than [Michael Porter](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Understanding_Michael_Porter/t5BaoG0tAoUC?hl=en): \
