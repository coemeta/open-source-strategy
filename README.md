# CoŒµmeta Open Source Strategy Repo

This is the **Open Source Strategy** repository for [CoŒµmeta](https://coemeta.xyz), a Public Benefit LLC providing data & sensemaking services with positive externalities. It's intended as: 

- a **collection of open-access resources** for other freelancers, 'solopreneurs' or small orgs ([squads](https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/) / [pods](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/pods) / [crews](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/practices/crewing) / [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) etc)
- a **public record of our evolving strategy, planning & execution**
- & a place for **collaboration, co-creation & collective sensemaking**

As our [name](/name.md) reflects, CoŒµmeta is about **_finding truth together_**. \
Making **better sense** for **better places** through **better information, relation & process**.

This repo complements our [**Public Work Log**](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log), which offers a more narrative account of our journey & playbook as it develops. All of this is done in the spirit of **[working in public](https://nesslabs.com/work-in-public)**, contributing to **[knowledge commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons)**, "**finding the others**" & **leaving a trail + some resources** for those that follow. 

Comments, questions & suggestions are welcome via **Pull Requests**, [**Issues**](https://github.com/coemeta/open-source-strategy/issues) or [**Discussions**](https://github.com/orgs/coemeta/discussions)!

> üôèüèº You can support our public benefit work with a donation via [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/coemeta) or [paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=7W4M66QGW3LT8)!

### Notes on strategy, frameworks & planning
</summary>

As [decision science](https://medium.com/coemeta/from-information-to-action-with-quantitative-decision-science-9752b6c969d5#4054) practitioners & general strategy nerds, we've seen how **the right framework can simplify, clarify & streamline the task of making sense of information & (potential) actions** ‚Äî __as long as we don't mistake the map for the territory__ **·µã**. So we've made ample use of various models & frameworks in the planning & execution of CoŒµmeta __to date__. 

***Note**: this repo contains snapshots in various states of refinement & iteration. Further, the frameworks are essentially just differently shaped containers filled with mostly the same content, but the varying shapes help emphasize (& scrutinize) different dimensions of the information & underlying intent, which is in fact much of the value of such frameworks.*

<br>

<details>
<summary>·µã <i>...a few more obligatory caveats & cautionary aphorisms regarding models & planning:</i></summary>

  - ["Plans are worthless, but planning is priceless"](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/18/planning/)
  - ["Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth"](https://www.commit.works/everyone-has-a-plan-until-they-get-punched-in-the-mouth/) 
  - ([Optionality](https://thedeepdish.org/optionality-book/) & [OODA loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) are often better than plans)
  - ["All models are wrong, but some are useful"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)
  - See generally: [complexity science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) & [chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory), e.g. [Robert May (1976)](https://medium.com/coemeta/the-logistic-map-the-onset-of-chaos-sonified-46fd73e25965#5174)
  - In fact the epsilon ("Œµ") in **__CoŒµmeta__** is meant as a reminder of the '[error margin](https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-communication-research-methods/i4630.xml)' in any model, estimate or probabilistic assessment. (see further details on this etymology on the [What's in a name?](/name.md) page)

### Why open? (shouldn't strategy be secret? ü§´)
</summary>

1. <details><summary><b>We're playing positive-sum, infinite games</b></summary> 

   \
   As a mission-driven org focused on prosocial impact, [positive externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive) & [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)), **we're not afraid of being copied**. \
   \
   In fact _**the more we're copied, the more we all win**_. This is partly because we're playing [a different game](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=An_Introduction_to_Game_B): a [positive-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win-win_game), [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games#Finite_vs._infinite_games) where we 'win' by continuing to play. The game is collective growth & regeneration, exchange over extraction, cooperation over competition, relationships over objects, process over products. This game favors [abundance mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Abundance_and_scarcity) & recognizes the [many forms of capital](http://www.appleseedpermaculture.com/8-forms-of-capital/) beyond money & property. \
   \
   But we're not naive about the need for traditional capital to 'stay in business' & stay alive. And **we're not afraid to compete** with traditional profit-maximizing, extractive, scarcity-based, zero-sum business models ‚Äî the old game. That game is dying of exhaustion, institutional decay, bureaucratic gridlock & most of all a hollow core ‚Äî lacking meaning & humanity: no vibes, no [lore](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/on-lore). **It can't do what we can do**: it's inhuman & unnatural, the system dynamics are self-annihiliting. It has to defy gravity, scale endlessly, deceive perpetually, genuflect to VCs or financial market casino games. It has to "win", [we just have to keep playing](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/how-to-not-lose-at-4d-chess). \
   \
   Their game is ending, as finite games must. Our game is endless, regenerative, life-giving, convivial, self-sustaining, its own reward. Everyday, [more](https://www.enspiral.com/) & [more](https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/) join our game & [leave](https://www.ft.com/content/1270ee18-3ee0-4939-98a8-c4f40940e644) the [old](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/millennials-burned-by-hustle-culture-5670986/). As many [always have](https://gnosisguild.mirror.xyz/t4F5rItMw4-mlpLZf5JQhElbDfQ2JRVKAzEpanyxW1Q). Regardless of what becomes of CoŒµmeta, the game endures.
   </details>
  
2. <details><summary><b>Classical Porterian business strategy</b></summary>
   
   \
   We can also justify this transparency on the terms of classical "old game" business strategy. In that world, it doesn't get much more canonical than [Michael Porter](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Understanding_Michael_Porter/t5BaoG0tAoUC?hl=en): \
