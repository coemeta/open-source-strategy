# What's in a name?

As initially described in our [first Public Work Log entry](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log/blob/main/2022.0.veu.md#-timeline), the name **Coεmeta** is a compound neologism / portmanteau with the overarching concept of _co-creation of knowledge & understanding_, or as stated in our [mission & vision statements](/mission-and-vision): __finding truth together__.


The core substring __emet__ (hebrew for "truth") is borrowed from [golem folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem), as inspired by [Richard McElreath](https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath)'s admonitions about statistical models as "golems" or "robots" in his [Statistical Rethinking course & textbook](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).

  - In that folklore, golems are clay monsters brought to life by inscribing "emet" (truth) on their forehead, & then 'decommissioned' by scratching out the initial character, to leave "met", meaning "death".

  - We play on this (a bit melodramatically, admittedly), by using an "ε" for the first "e" in **__Coεmeta__**, which is meant as a reminder of the '[error](https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-communication-research-methods/i4630.xml) margin' in any model, estimate or probabilistic assessment

Beyond that, the "[co](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/co-)" (together) & "[meta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta)" (big picture) substrings should be pretty self-explanatory

Finally, the resulting composite __Coεmeta__ has resonances with a few other somewhat obscure terms which are personally meaningful: 
  - ***[Gallia Comata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaul#Social_structure,_indigenous_nation_and_clans)*** - literally "**long-haired Gauls**" or "**free Gaul**", referring to ancient lands & peoples not yet conquered, colonized & "civilized" by Romans
  - ***[Coimimeadh](https://tadhgtalks.me/2016/10/18/celtic-thought-c-is-for-coimimeadh-the-co-traveller/)*** [koym-imah] - a Scots Gaelic word referring to "**co-walker**" or "**co-traveller**" spirits
