# üèõ  Strategic Pillars (types of work)

This is not so much a framework as a **simple taxonomy that underlies the overarching vision & strategy for CoŒµmeta,** specifically regarding the types of "work" we do. These might be thought of as "business units", "verticals", or "functional areas" in more traditional [corporate](https://www.cascade.app/blog/strategy-levels) or [functional strategy](https://www.business-to-you.com/levels-of-strategy-corporate-business-functional/).

The pillars are:

---

| **Freelance & contract work** | **Content creation** | **Open source toolmaking** | **Relations & community-building** |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Traditional hourly rate or project-based work, consulting etc. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Part of Working In Public as well as building a public presence, portfolio & demonstration of capabilities, etc. <br><br> All with an orientation towards [positive externalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive), [public goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_%28economics%29) & contribution to [knowledge commons,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_commons) etc. | Creating [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) & [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) tools & resources. <br><br> Related to & overlapping with **Content creation**, but with a more technical & functional focus, vs informational & didactic resources. <br><br> Again oriented towards public goods, etc. | Building networks of mutual support, partnership & exchange, etc (e.g. [mutual aid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_%28organization_theory%29) & [microsolidarity](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/)). <br><br> _(More conventionally / cynically: networking, growth hacking, clout chasing, social climbing, etc. But intent is more positive-sum.)_ |

---

It was obvious & important to enumerate these as we initially conceived of the core activities of CoŒµmeta, & they recur throughout the other frameworks for obvious reasons. Once enumerated, they provoke an obvious followup question: how they relate to each other via interconnections, interdependencies & feedback loops, which subsequent frameworks explore below.

### üì¶  Strategic Pillar 2x2s (++): Certainty vs Scalability (+ feedback loops & interdependencies)
</summary>
    
Of course we can't avoid some sort of [2x2](https://managementconsulted.com/2x2-matrix/), the ~~bullshit peddler~~ management consultant's favorite WMD (weapon of mass defrauding). However, we feel these mutant versions are sufficiently novel & abstruse to avoid the most pathological forms of consultant-itus. And anyway, all such frameworks operate similarly via some sort of complexity- or dimensionality-reduction (e.g. of the true territory to an approximate map). 2x2's just tend to be among the most egregiously reductive.

Nevertheless, these help to visualize a few pertinent dimensions of these pillars & the relations between them.

> *There's a lot going on in these, both visually & conceptually, but suffice to say: the right-side is identical to the left-side, with additional arrows indicating potential feedback loops (& their relative strengths, via line type & weight). Just wanted to preserve a cleaner / simpler version on the left, without the Feedback Loop dimension.*


The **dimensions** we wanted to capture & convey:

  - **Certainty of Outcome** (x-axis): for some fixed amount effort or 'input', how confident can we be in the outcome or 'payoff'
  - **Scalability (LOE vs potential outcome)** (y-axis): how high is the 'payoff' ceiling for some fixed amount of effort / input
  - **Potential Outcome Range** (inner circles, see legends): a sort of confidence interval or distribution around the range of expected outcomes or payoffs. 
__(We're most dissatisfied with the clarity & interpretability of this element)__
  - **Feedback Loops & Interdependencies** (arrows, right-side): Fairly self-explanatory, how outputs & outcomes from one pillar / node might impact or contribute to another, & what virtuous cycles ([flywheel](https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel)!), efficiency-gains & tactics this might imply
  - __(as is probably clear, these dimensions are not entirely orthogonal / independent from each other, but worth distinguishing to be able to reason about their relative potentials & strategic implications)__

<summary> 

Per usual, We're not entirely satisfied with these, but they served their immediate purpose: to clarify fuzzy notions in our head, via marginally-less-fuzzy lines on a surface. The result is fairly dense with info, assumptions & implications, but if you stare & squint long enough, **some observations** emerge: (click to expand)</summary>

  - <details><summary><b>Freelance</b> work is depicted as <b>high-certainty & low-scalability</b> (`x` vs `y` axis), with a <b>narrow outcome range</b> (inner circle viz) & <b>several interdependencies</b> (arrows). Let's unpack that: </summary>

      - **High-certainty**: Due to the contractual nature of this work, outcomes & payoffs are pre-specified to some degree, resulting in relatively high certainty. __NB: non-monetary outcomes (e.g. social impacts) are obviously less certain, & this does not account for the inherent uncertainty in __**__securing__**__ freelance work, but rather applies to the work itself, if & when secured.__
      - **Low-scalability**: Again, due to the contractual nature, it's unlikely that we'll agree to a fixed rate & scope of work & then end up making 10x that, without an additional ~10x effort. Thus the [marginal gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginal-profit.asp) per unit of work are fairly constrained.
      - **Narrow outcome range**: Again related to the pre-specified __quid pro quo__ nature of contract work, the expected outcome range is fairly bounded by the rates I'm willing to accept vs the rates clients are willing to pay, & most often will fall somewhere in the middle. Of course it's always possible that some extreme outlier event occurs, or an enormous non-monetary impact is achieved, but we're working in the realm of averages outcomes & [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) here. 
      - **Interdependencies**: The theory depicted here is that the other 3 pillars all might contribute fairly strongly to freelance work (e.g. by generating interest, growing network connections & referrals, etc). But freelance work will only contribute weakly back to them (e.g. by open-sourcing work projects, generating ideas for content creation, & growing the network of contacts & partnerships). And a happy client is often a repeat client or referrer, so freelance work can lead to more of itself. These hypotheses, like everything else in these frameworks, will have to be tested in practice & adjusted accordingly. (science!)  </details>
  
<br>

  - <details><summary>By way of contrast: <b>Content creation</b> is depicted as <b>low-certainty & highly-scalable</b>, with a <b>wide outcome range</b> (skewed toward the low end) & again <b>several interdependencies</b>. I won't elaborate these in the same detail, but suffice to say:</summary>

      - Any given piece of content is most likely to attract a very small audience, but could possibly go viral with practically unbounded upside for the same level of effort. This accounts for the **first 3 dimensions**. 
      - As far as **interdependencies**, it should be fairly self-evident that creating content might lead to creating technical implementations & vice versa, as well as attracting some audience, potential collaborators & clients. </details>

<br>

  - The same reasoning is applied to the other two pillars, so won't belabor them here. 
  - Will just comment that **this exercise helped to crystallize & confirm some assumptions**, & convince us of an **initial strategic focus on the more scalable pillars** while having some cushion & runway to experiment & roll the dice for a potential big payoff, or at least build some more scalable foundations & start seeding the ground / greasing the [flywheel](https://www.hubspot.com/flywheel).

<br> 

**Final notes** on these mutant 2x2s:
  - **Each pillar of course has its own (sub)strategy & tactics**, integrated w/ the macro strategy, which we'll publish here in the future. 
  - **Locations of pillars / nodes in the x-y plane should not be static**, but could (or should) be moved (as part of strategy).
  - **Temporal aspects are not captured, but there is a temporal strategy implied** (as mentioned above):
      - initially invest in low-certainty / high-potential work, to seed flywheel dynamics
      - partnerships as potential interim / intermediary accelerant / amplifier
      - freelance as 'safety net' fallback of safer bets but lower potential
