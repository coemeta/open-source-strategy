### About OKRs

[Objectives & Key Results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) or OKRs are a goal-setting framework native to Silicon Valley & made popular (or notorious) by Google. They've become [much maligned](https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1337086699118063616) & [parodied](https://twitter.com/mdavidallen/status/1181964335700221953), probably due to being [misused](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1522235499749908482), [overused & abused](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1499772366087340037).

But ultimately **OKRs are about as simple & lightweight a container as imaginable** for defining **strategic __Objectives__** & assigning a few **measurable __Results__** which should represent concrete progress towards the goal. Given this simplicity & flexibility, the devil has lots of room to lurk in the details & implementation. 

But we've used OKRs productively both personally & within work teams, & developed 2 [custom Google Sheet templates](#get-co%CE%B5metas-quarterly-okr-templates) tailored to our particular use.
