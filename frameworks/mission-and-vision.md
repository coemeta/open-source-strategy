### _What is a Metagame?_
</summary>

Coεmeta is an attempt at an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games). _The goal of infinite games is not to win, but to keep playing._

We call this the **_metagame_** (as opposed to endgame):

> _A more **potent** & **integrated** life in **greater community**_

To upack this a bit: 

#### **Potency**
* agency, autononomy, sovereignty
  * self-determination, self-direction
* impact, efficacy

#### **Integrity**
* holism
  * less fragmented / compartmentalized / reductive / spreadsheet-brained
* balance
  * right-relation (between parts / facets / dimensions)
* regeneration
  * physical, psychological, social, ecological (etc) restoration & revitalization

#### **Community**
* commons, prosociality, conviviality
  * reweaving social fabric
* (& the other things above shared in & partaken of more commonly)

### _Notes on mission & vision statements_
</summary>

[Mission & Vision statements](https://www.bain.com/insights/management-tools-mission-and-vision-statements/) are notoriously wonky & vacuous standard MBA-ware. But they can be useful exercises in distillation of values & intention, & sometimes produce helpful mantras for orientation & alignment. Sort of qualitative "north stars".
 
The rule of thumb we use: **Vision** describes the __big picture outcome__ you want to realize, **Mission** describes _**how**_ you'll do it.
 
It's hard to be simultaneously concise, substantive & clear, so lapsing into banal tropes & cliches is a common pitfall — which we haven't yet managed to entirely avoid. Familiar shorthands are useful compressions! But also risk total [semantic satiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation) & meaninglessness. So we haven't yet found a satisfying alternative to the facile "[better world / place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso) / [communities](https://beta-share.descript.com/view/BBwMr30NgNy?t=473)" shibboleths.

As mentioned, we're not fully satisfied with these, due to cliches, clunky phrasing & some niche jargon (sensemaking, positive externalities, etc). But the general vibe is right, & we try to clarify the jargon via context, elaboration & reference links. We also include verbs in the vision as well as nouns, to emphasize the importance of __process__ beyond any static outcome or state. Will continue to workshop, like everything else.

### _Notes on v2 revisions / changelog (2026)_
</summary>

After a bit of a hiatus / digital cleanse (but no intermission in the infinite game) we revisited these conceptions to find that our actual gameplay had evolved, expanded & deepened. So we refined these things to reflect this. (see associated Public Work Log TKTKTK for more on this)

Major changes & some of the underlying context & motivation:

<summary>

#### 1. Added the [Metagame](#the-metagame-see-notes-for-details)
</summary>

  This had been present in some form since the beginning, but only mentioned explicitly in [Public Work Logs](https://github.com/coemeta/public-work-log). 
     
  The original formulation was: 
  > _a more **balanced**, **integrated**, **enriching** & *impactful* life in **greater community**_
  
  ... which, was a bit cumbersome — somewhat of a longwinded litany — yet still somehow missing essential elements of current gameplay. 
      
  It captured most of it, & had a certain musicality. Rolled off the tongue with alliteration & rhythm.
  But it was a lot, & yet too little.
    
  So the goal was to **_refine & deepen_**: simplify at the first level, but weave nested & networked complexity underneath.
  
  And after many exasperated iterations, landed on the current  version with some (but not total) satisfaction:

  > _A more **potent** & **integrated** life in **greater community**_
  > * **Potency:**
  >   * agency, autononomy, sovereignty
  >     * self-determination, self-direction
  >   * impact, efficacy
  > * **Integrity**
  >   * holism
  >     * less fragmented / compartmentalized / reductive / spreadsheet-brained
  >   * balance
  >     * right-relation (between parts / facets / dimensions)
  >   * regeneration
  >     * physical, psychological, social, ecological (etc) restoration & revitalization
  > * **Community**
  >   * commons, prosociality, conviviality
  >     * reweaving social fabric
  >   * (& the other things above shared in & partaken of more commonly)

  Essentially: distilled the prior litany into _**potency**, **integrity** & **community**_, & folded the details (& missing bits) underneath.

#### 2. Revised [Vision](#vision)
</summary>

The true original version of this was:

  >  _A **better world** through **better information**_

But soon jettisoned the ["better world" trope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso) in favor of _a bit_ more concreteness, specificity & localism, with various permutations of:

  > _Better **places**, **process** & **relation** through **better information**_

 By 2026, this again felt like a bit too much & yet not enough: longwinded, yet narrowly focused on "information" as _the work_.

 It was missing essential components of regeneration & sociality. ("Relations" are mentioned, but positioned as more of a side-effect of information work, rather than an area of effort in their own right). 

I wrestled with this a bit: data & sensemaking (infowork) _was_ the main offering of Coεmeta as previously conceived (& my primary area of expertise & professional experience). 

But it is decidely not the totality of _work to be done_, or that I feel increasingly called to do. And _"more integrated"_ was always right there in the [metagame](#the-metagame-see-notes-for-details), as it still is. And I was certainly living this more integrated vision, so might as well say it. 

So I tentatively landed on: 

> _**Systemic regeneration** through **better information** & **collaboration**_

_...or more simply:_

> _Making **better sense** for a **better world**, **together**_

It occured to me that all the "better places, process...etc" can really fall under the unbrella of regenerative work, but also wanted to stress the aspect of multiple domains or systems in need of regeneration. (this is, afterall, the [polycrisis](https://news.lifeitself.org/p/from-polycrisis-to-metacrisis-a-short) / [metacrisis](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world))

Some alternate formulations considered:
* Multi-system regeneration ...
* Systems regeneration ...
* Cross-system regeneration ...
* Broad scale regeneration ...

While "multi-system..." or simply "systems.." were probably the most correct formulations, I felt like "systemic regeneration" was the most likely to be understood by the most people at first blush. "Systemic change" is a familiar enough trope, so this seemed like the _least-arcane-jargon_ option. (Though I may change my mind). 

Either way, "systemic regeneration" is still a bit of a mouthful, & its meaning likely not immediately obvious to most people. But I'm generally ok with this because:

1. I also brought back the generic "better world" trope as a simpler alternative for this reason
2. Vision statements are meant to be a bit evocative, while the paired Mission statement is meant to be more concrete.

Speaking of which...

#### 3. Expanded [Mission](#mission)
</summary>

Mission was always a bit of a knotty one, trying to encapsulate _all the work_ in reasonably concrete terms.

It started sensibly enough:

> **Create data & sensemaking tools & services** with [**positive externalities**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive): supporting [**commons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons), [**public goods**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_%28economics%29), [**circular**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy) & [**solidarity economies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy) & **prosocial change**.

More jargon-packing, but mostly to the point. But soon wanted to emphasize this work as a lever, an amplifier for good work 

...eventually evolved into several permutations of: 

> **Be a lever for positive impact**, amplifying prosocial efforts though **improved empirical practice & capacities** 


> ...by 
>   * **Taking a holistic approach to empirical sensemaking,** beyond the biased fragility of purely quantitative methods: drawing on **[qualitative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research)** “**[thick](https://medium.com/ethnography-matters/why-big-data-needs-thick-data-b4b3e75e3d7)**” & “**[warm data](https://warmdatalab.net/warm-data)**” embedded in **people, places, process & relations** — **[complexity science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system) & [decolonial](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ces/research/current/socialtheory/maps/decolonising/) [methods](http://sigdoc.acm.org/cdq/decolonizing-decoloniality-considering-the-misuse-of-decolonial-frameworks-in-tpc-scholarship/),** honoring **many** **[ways of knowing](https://www.criaw-icref.ca/images/userfiles/files/Fact%20Sheet%202%20EN%20FINAL.pdf)**
>   * **Creating data & sensemaking tools & services** with [**positive externalities**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive): supporting [**commons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons), [**public goods**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_%28economics%29), [**circular**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy) & [**solidarity economies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy) & **prosocial change**.
>   * **Building capacity & community** via **collaboration**, **partnership**, **mentorship** & **mutual-aid**

As a coda, I'll just say: 

I can't pretend like I don't feel a bit silly investing this much time & (over)thinking into _mere words_ ABOUT work, ...instead of doing more of the work itself. 

But to be fair:

1. I spent the the better part of the last 2 years on a bit of a digital & intellectual sabbatical, focused more on _doing_ than theorizing & documenting. (...among other diversions & side-quests)
2. Charging ahead without looking up every once in a while rarely gets you where you actually want to go. (Action is the last step of the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) for a reason...& it is a loop)
3. Much of this is for me as much as anyone else. Process more than product. 
4. Words & ideas are powerful, magickal forces (& should be revered as well as feared as such). Language is perhaps our greatest & most terrible technology — our largest lever. The written word, a particularly rough beast. 

...and with that said, I'll leave it there.
