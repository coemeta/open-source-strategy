# ðŸ”­  CoÎµmeta Mission & Vision statements â€” v1.4

### Vision (some permutation of):

> **Better places**, **process** & **relation** through **better information**: _**finding truth together**_

### Mission: 

> Act as **a lever for positive impact**, amplifying prosocial efforts by **raising the standard of empirical practice**, with a focus on **people**, **place** & **process** in **better relation**.
>
> **Create data & sensemaking tools & services** with [**positive externalities**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive): supporting [**commons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons), [**public goods**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_%28economics%29), [**circular**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy) & [**solidarity economies**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy) & **prosocial change**.

#### _Notes on mission & vision statements_
</summary>

[Mission & Vision statements](https://www.bain.com/insights/management-tools-mission-and-vision-statements/) are notoriously wonky & vacuous standard MBA-ware. But they can be useful exercises in distillation of values & intention, & sometimes produce helpful mantras for orientation & alignment. Sort of qualitative "north stars".
 
The rule of thumb we use: **Vision** describes the __big picture outcome__ you want to realize, **Mission** describes _**how**_ you'll do it.
 
It's hard to be simultaneously concise, substantive & clear, so lapsing into banal tropes & cliches is a common pitfall â€” which we haven't yet managed to entirely avoid. Familiar shorthands are useful compressions! But also risk total [semantic satiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation) & meaninglessness. So we haven't yet found a satisfying alternative to the facile "[better world / place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8C5sjjhsso) / [communities](https://beta-share.descript.com/view/BBwMr30NgNy?t=473)" shibboleths.

As mentioned, we're not fully satisfied with these, due to cliches, clunky phrasing & some niche jargon (sensemaking, positive externalities, etc). But the general vibe is right, & we try to clarify the jargon via context, elaboration & reference links. We also include verbs in the vision as well as nouns, to emphasize the importance of __process__ beyond any static outcome or state. Will continue to workshop, like everything else.
