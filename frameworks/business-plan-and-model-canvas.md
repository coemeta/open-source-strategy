# 📝  Business Plan & Business Model Canvas — v1.0

More standard MBA-ware, developed in consultation with local [SBDC](https://www.pasbdc.org/) & [SCORE](https://philadelphia.score.org/) organizations (both of which are free & have been enormously helpful & valuable in different ways — highly recommended!).

These were fairly early iterations, & our latest thinking & formulations are currently better reflected on the Coεmeta landing page ([coemeta.xyz](https://coemeta.xyz)). But worth including for reference:

<details><summary>These are mostly self-explanatory & but a few further <b>comments</b>: </summary>
  
  - Despite being mostly redundant, it occurred to me for the first time during the canvas exercise that "excellence & efficiency" was core to my past career success & work ethic, & worth making an explicit part of Coεmeta's value proposition. This speaks to the value of revisiting these prompts from different angles via different frameworks & formats, etc. 
  - It's a bit unconventional to specify **'non-customer' segments** in these things, but I firmly believe [Michael Porter's axiom](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Michael_Porter#%22What_is_strategy?,%22_1996): "**The essence of strategy is choosing what __not__ to do**", despite the rarity of this in practice (much like [strategy itself](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/most-companies-dont-have-strategy-says-harvard-school-joseph/)). Of course, like anything else, this focus might change over time.

  - **Part of the thesis** for Coεmeta, & why it might work, is **how poorly orgs are currently served by data operations**...

  - ... & **how demand continues to grow despite that fact** (this also points to an eventual reckoning & bubble-burst)
