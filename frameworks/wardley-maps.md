# ðŸ—º  Wardley Maps â€” v 1.0
</summary>

[Wardley Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map) are probably the most novel & exotic frameworks in this repo, but also among the most illuminating, & therefore the ones we spent the most time with. These were facilitated & refined over two super productive sessions with [Ben Mosior](https://twitter.com/HiredThought) of [Hired Thought](https://hiredthought.com/) & [LearnWardleyMapping.com](https://learnwardleymapping.com/) (highly recommended!).

Will defer to Ben, [Simon](https://twitter.com/swardley) & other experts to explain [how to use & interpret Wardley Maps](https://learnwardleymapping.com/), but in general they are read as [value chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain) of user needs & the capabilities they depend on (top to bottom) along an "evolutionary" x-axis depicting the stage of development for each element of the value chain (left to right). The basic usage is like that of any map: interrogate the landscape & use it to plot a course of action.

We created maps of 4 categories of potential "users" of CoÎµmeta's work (as clients, collaborators, content consumers, etc):

---

| Nonprofits & social impact orgs | Small business, startups & solopreneurs |

| DAOs | Content consumers, learners, mentees|

And then one metamap for CoÎµmeta itself:

Some general **notes & observations**:
  - **Relative position & general proximity** is more important than precise location on the map, so we didn't overthink these initial placements along the evolutionary x-axis.
  - <details><summary> <b>Nonprofit, Small Biz & DAOs all had essentially the same relative positions, but less spread across</b> the x-axis. Some differences:</summary>

      - Nonprofit / mission-driven orgs think much more about desired outcomes, & generally have info & reporting standards & requirements, so might have more relative maturity & infrastructure in those areas
      - DAOs are digital-native & technically advanced, which correlates with data & info maturity
      - DAOs (& some nonprofits) have additional(ly salient) needs of collective intelligence & coordination & community-building due to their nature, which present more challenges / opportunities</details>

<br>

  - <details><summary><b>For all:</b></summary>
  
    - Stage 4 areas can be an entry point / low-hanging fruit to demonstrate value if not fully adopting current best practices
      - e.g. tool adoption / implementation, automation of manual efforts
    - Can then work down (& up) value chains depending on need
    - Moving other nodes rightward is generally high-LOE & low-certainty, but can look for quick wins, e.g.:
      - applying sensemaking frameworks like logic model / outcome mapping, integrating with evaluation & monitoring systems
      - facilitating decision & activation frameworks
      - doing underlying work required beyond their current capacities
      - training / advising to increase capacities</details>

<br>

  - We applied these & other takeaways to refined value propositions, service descriptions & other copy on the initial [CoÎµmeta landing page](https://coemeta.xyz), as well as my approach with initial clients & potential collaborators. But again, all of this bears experimentation, validation & iteration.
