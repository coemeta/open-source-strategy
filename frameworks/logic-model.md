# 🧠  Logic Model
</summary>

[Logic Models](https://www.social-impact-navigator.org/planning-impact/logic-model/logic-model/) are common, longstanding frameworks in project management & social impact work, & have recently gained traction in Product Management via "[Outcomes-based planning](https://amplitude.com/blog/move-from-outputs-to-outcomes)". 

As the name suggests, logic models ask us to specify the logical sequence of events or activities we expect to produce our desired outcome. This is often simply an instantiation of the underlying [Theory of Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_change), & we might interpret this as the __logic__ underlying how we expect to get from [Mission -> Vision](/frameworks/mission-and-vision.md)

In one of its simplest forms, this involves mapping [Inputs -> Outputs -> Outcomes](https://www.thecompassforsbc.org/how-to-guides/how-develop-logic-model-0). Each of these terms is defined in a specific way in this context, & some models use additional or alternate concepts such as Resources, Activities, Impacts, etc. 

We haven't formally articulated a Theory of Change yet, but it is implicit in the (very rough) initial Logic Model draft below. In addition to being a rough draft, the only visual version so far was created with [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/)'s janky `{{diagram}}` functionality, so isn't pretty, but again suffices as an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). Will refine & draft in a proper visual tool in the future.

Brief notes on the model:
  - If not clear, the model should be read bottom-to-top, as the logical flow proceeds from **Inputs -> Outputs -> Outcomes -> Impacts**
  - Our familiar [🏛  Strategic Pillars (types of work)](#--strategic-pillars-types-of-work) appear here as **Outputs**, arranged in columns, with the first row essentially serving as column names (**Freelance, Relation, Content, Tools**) with individual output metrics beneath them, & roughly corresponding **Outcome** metrics above. See [📊  Metrics / KPIs / Dashboard](#--metrics--kpis--dashboard) for more on these.
  - The connecting lines & arrows are mostly unreadable in this format (& have no functionality within Roam), so didn't spend much time there
  - A strategic focus & overarching thesis of Coεmeta that is so far less explicit in other frameworks, but evident among some Impacts here: **an expectation of continued institutional decay, & corresponding need for resilient peer-to-peer support networks outside of institutional contexts**. (One modality of this is an increasingly "unbundled" future of work, as feedback loops continue to accelerate [Great Resignation dynamics](https://twitter.com/dnlmc/status/1467895998051725316) & [increased independent worker / gig economy / solopreneurship](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/flip-side-great-resignation-small-business-boom-rcna10356))
  - As with everything, but particularly this early draft, the model will be empirically evaluated & refined as appropriate.
